                           Build a (micro-)service Web system able to "intelligently" recommend – by exposing a SPARQL endpoint – vinyl music 
                            records according to various criteria: user preferences (specified via controlled natural language constructs such as 
                            "I always like/love/prefer classical music, especially opera music by Rossini or Verdi and performed by Angela Gheorghiu or 
                            Juan Diego Flórez; I sometimes like progressive rock and post-rock; I like only metal albums released before 2000; 
                            I always dislike/hate rap and hip-hop; I dislike songs produced by Flood in the last 25 years"), 
                            past song purchases on various music stores, playlists – available online via music streaming services: Last.fm and 
                            alternative solutions – and/or locally – for instance, by uploading a JSPF/XSPF document. 
                            The playlists could be created by the user or shared by her/his virtual "friends" (consider at least one social network). 
                            The system will use several music-related knowledge models (e.g., Music Ontology or MusicRecording concept from schema.org) 
                            and available public resources: Discogs, MusicBrainz, Musicmoz Music Styles.

                            An end user is a person who uses a product or service. This individual isn't necessarily the one who purchases a product but the one who ultimately uses it.
                            For our application we have two main end users:
                            <ol>
                                <li>A person that shows interest in music and wants to discover more and more music similar to his taste</li>
                                <li>Developer that wants to integrate a music recommandation component in his application</li>
                            <ol>
